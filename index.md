# Computation Perception — F2601

Welcome to the class Computation Perception Extended - F26

## Quick Links

- [Syllabus](syllabus.md)
- [Class Notes](./class-notes/)

## Course Overview

**Format:** Weekly sessions + guided self-study + final project  
**Audience:** Students in art, design, and creative technology  
**Prerequisites:** No advanced ML background required (basic coding literacy is recommended)

Short class description:

> AI tools are everywhere, but understanding how they work opens very different creative possibilities.
> This module explores the open-source roots of ML/AI, from neural-network foundations to current tools and practices.
> Through hands-on experimentation with open-source frameworks, students move beyond proprietary interfaces and develop independent creative workflows.
> The class culminates in a final project with transparent process, documentation, and code.

## 1. What you are going to learn

### Professional competences

- Students integrate AI models into experimental and artistic contexts to develop original digital experiences.
- Students adapt and remix existing AI systems or datasets to create new forms of expression.
- Students analyze and evaluate how AI influences meaning, participation, and authorship in digital art and design.

### Methodological competences

- Students translate technical exploration into coherent and meaningful creative outcomes.
- Students demonstrate transparency in design and decision-making when working with AI systems and data.

### Personal competences

- Students evaluate the balance between automation and creative agency within AI-driven practices.
- Students reflect critically on the cultural, ethical, and social implications of AI in art and design.

## Block Composition

The class is composed from independent block repositories added in `content/blocks/` as git submodules.

| Week | Block | Topic | Slides |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `block-ai-intro-core` | AI/ML/DL foundations, history, and key concepts | [slides-ai-intro-core](https://subdomain.yourdomain.com/slides-ai-intro-core/) |
| 02 | `block-...` | Open-source workflows and experimentation | [slides-...](https://subdomain.yourdomain.com/slides-.../) |
| 03 | `block-...` | Creative applications and critical analysis | [slides-...](https://subdomain.yourdomain.com/slides-.../) |
| 04+ | `block-...` | Project development, feedback, and finalization | [slides-...](https://subdomain.yourdomain.com/slides-.../) |

Notes:

- Blocks are maintained in their own `block-*` repositories.
- Slides are maintained in separate `slides-*` repositories.
- This class repo links to slides by URL only.
