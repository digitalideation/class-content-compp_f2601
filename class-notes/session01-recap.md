# Creative AI – Session 1 Summary

## Course Structure

**Communication:** Slack (primary channel)  
**Content:** GitHub course page (main material)  
**Tools:** JupyterHub (HSLU server), Python  

### Semester Plan

**Phase 1 – Exploration (First Half)**

- AI foundations
- Machine Learning basics
- Prompting
- Generative tools (image, audio, video)
- Hands-on experimentation

**Phase 2 – Project Work (Second Half)**

- Individual or group project
- Research + documentation
- Tutoring-style sessions
- Final presentation

## Core Concepts Introduced

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Broad field of computer science creating systems that simulate intelligent behavior.

### Machine Learning (ML)

Subset of AI where:

- Algorithms learn patterns from data.
- Instead of writing explicit rules, the system learns rules from examples.

#### Classical Programming

Input + Rules → Output

#### Machine Learning

Input + Correct Output → Model learns Rules

## Neural Networks & Deep Learning

Neural networks consist of:

- Input layer
- Hidden layers
- Output layer
- Weights (parameters between neurons)

**Deep Learning** = many stacked layers.
“Deep” refers to depth (layers), not intelligence.

## How Training Works

Training loop:

1. Forward pass (make prediction)
2. Compare with correct answer
3. Compute loss (error)
4. Adjust weights (backpropagation)
5. Repeat many times

After training:

- The model is saved as a large “weights file”
- Applications access it via APIs
- Example: ChatGPT = web interface → server → trained model

## Why AI Is Powerful Today

- Massive datasets
- High computational power (GPUs)
- Cloud infrastructure

The ideas are not new — the scale is.

## Ethical & Practical Themes

- AI use is encouraged.
- Transparency is important.
- Explain your process, not only results.
- AI should be treated as a tool or collaborator.

## Technical Introduction (Hands-On)

Students worked with:

- Jupyter Notebook (Python environment)
- Virtual machines on HSLU server

### Python Basics Covered

- Printing text
- Variables
- f-strings
- Lists
- For-loops
- Random selection
- Dictionaries
- Functions with parameters

Key idea:  
Changing function parameters changes outputs.  
This mirrors how ML models adjust weights to change predictions.

## Learning Philosophy

- Peer learning encouraged.
- Experimentation is expected.
- Breaking things is part of learning.
- Growth happens outside the comfort zone.

## For Next Week

- Watch recommended neural network video (3Blue1Brown)
- Explore Jupyter if interested
- Bring one interesting AI example to discuss
