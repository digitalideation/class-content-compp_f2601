- **Contact:** guillaume.massol@hslu.ch
- **Schedule:** Monday 18:30 - 20:50
- **Location:** Online

## Course Description

AI tools are increasingly present in everyday creative workflows, but understanding how they function enables a different level of agency.

This class explores the open-source roots and collaborative history of ML/AI, tracing neural networks from academic research to contemporary ecosystems. Students work hands-on with open-source frameworks and methods, moving beyond black-box proprietary interfaces.

The module emphasizes durable knowledge and core principles over short-term fluency in one platform. The course culminates in a final project developed with transparent process, documentation, and code.

## Learning Outcomes

### Professional competences

- Students integrate AI models into experimental and artistic contexts to develop original digital experiences.
- Students adapt and remix existing AI systems or datasets to create new forms of expression.
- Students analyze and evaluate how AI influences meaning, participation, and authorship in digital art and design.

### Methodological competences

- Students translate technical exploration into coherent and meaningful creative outcomes.
- Students demonstrate transparency in design and decision-making when working with AI systems and data.

### Personal competences

- Students evaluate the balance between automation and creative agency within AI-driven practices.
- Students reflect critically on the cultural, ethical, and social implications of AI in art and design.

## Policies

### Academic Integrity

Credit is a central value in open-source and commons-based creative practice. You are expected to cite the source of any code, model, dataset, or external resource you use.

Guidelines:

- Use libraries and frameworks responsibly, and acknowledge authors and repositories.
- Distinguish clearly between borrowed components and your own original contribution.
- Avoid copying complete artworks or project code and making superficial modifications.
- If external material is reused, explain what was reused, why, and how you transformed it.

### Collaboration

Collaboration is encouraged when it supports learning, with clear attribution and transparent roles.

- Giving and receiving technical help is allowed and encouraged.
- Any help received must be acknowledged in project documentation.
- Collaborative projects require explicit agreement with the instructor.
- Each participant must document their own contribution.
- When in doubt, give credit.
