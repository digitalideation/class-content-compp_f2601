# Computation Perception (F2601)

Welcome to the class Computation Perception Extended - F26

## Quick Links

- [Weekly Studio Structure](weekly-studio-structure.md)
- [Class Notes (tba)](./class-notes/)

## Course Overview

**Format:** Weekly sessions + guided self-study + final project
**Audience:** Students in art, design, and creative technology
**Prerequisites:** No advanced ML background required (basic coding literacy is recommended)

Short class description:

> AI tools are everywhere, but understanding how they work opens very different creative possibilities.  
> This module explores the open-source roots of ML/AI, from neural-network foundations to current tools and practices.  
> Through hands-on experimentation with open-source frameworks, we will move beyond proprietary interfaces and develop independent creative workflows.
>        
> The class ends with a final project with transparent process, documentation, and code.

## What you are going to learn

### Professional competences

- Students integrate AI models into experimental and artistic contexts to develop original digital experiences.
- Students adapt and remix existing AI systems or datasets to create new forms of expression.
- Students analyze and evaluate how AI influences meaning, participation, and authorship in digital art and design.

### Methodological competences

- Students translate technical exploration into coherent and meaningful creative outcomes.
- Students demonstrate transparency in design and decision-making when working with AI systems and data.

### Personal competences

- Students evaluate the balance between automation and creative agency within AI-driven practices.
- Students reflect critically on the cultural, ethical, and social implications of AI in art and design.

## Block Composition

The class is composed from independent block repositories added in `content/blocks/` as git submodules.

| Week | Block                 | Topic                                           | Content                                          | Slides                                                           |

Notes:

- Blocks are maintained in their own `block-*` repositories.
- Slides are maintained in separate `slides-*` repositories.

## Weekly Studio Practice

This course is structured as an active studio environment.

Each session begins with a short collective perception round, and may include participatory formats depending on the current block.

The detailed description of these formats is available here:

See: [Weekly Studio Structure](weekly-studio-structure.md)

Engagement is a core part of the learning process in this class.

## Tools

- Python + notebooks (Jupyter / Colab)
- Open-source ML/AI libraries and models
- Git-based documentation and project sharing

## Academic Integrity

Use external code, datasets, and references responsibly:

- Cite all reused code and resources.
- Clearly distinguish your own work from borrowed material.
- Acknowledge all collaborators and support received.
