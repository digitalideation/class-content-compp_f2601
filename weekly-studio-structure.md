# Weekly Studio Structure

Computation Perception is designed as an active studio environment — even in an online setting.

In addition to lectures and block-specific content, each session will include:

1. [Weekly Perception Check](#1-weekly-perception-check)
2. [Modular participatory formats](#2-modular-participatory-formats)

Sessions may include modular participatory formats. These are activated depending on the theme, technical focus, and phase of the course.

Not every format is used every week. Each block emphasizes different combinations.

## 1. Weekly Perception Check

At the beginning of each session, we take 5–10 minutes for a collective perception round.

Each participant (students + lecturer) shares 2–3 things they noticed during the week:

- Something involving AI, algorithms, or automation
- Something encountered online or in real life
- Something subtle, surprising, beautiful, strange, or problematic

This is not about what you produced. It is about what you perceived.

## 2. Modular participatory formats

### Live Micro-Experiment (≈10 min)

A short in-class prompt where everyone produces something quickly.

Examples:

- Break or misuse a model intentionally
- Change only one parameter and observe the shift
- Produce the "most boring" output possible
- Apply a strict constraint (limited data, limited lines of code, no visuals, etc.)

Purpose:

- Lower the barrier to experimentation
- Encourage risk-taking
- Keep energy active in an online setting

Low stakes. Fast sharing. Process over polish.

### Rotating Student Curator (≈5 min)

Each week, one student briefly presents:

- A tool, paper, artwork, dataset, repository, or platform
- Why it matters
- One critical reflection or limitation

Purpose:

- Build collective research culture
- Distribute responsibility
- Develop critical framing skills

Over the semester, the class builds a shared reference ecosystem.

### Black Box Question (Breakout Discussion)

Small groups respond to one focused conceptual question related to the current block.

Examples:

- Where does "intelligence" actually occur in this system?
- What is automated vs what remains human?
- Who is invisible in this pipeline?
- What assumptions are embedded in this dataset?

Groups return with a short summary statement.

Purpose:

- Prevent passive listening
- Connect theory to practice
- Encourage critical articulation

### Peer Mini-Feedback (Project Phase)

During project development, students present work-in-progress briefly.

Feedback follows a strict structure:

- One thing that works
- One question
- One risk to take

Purpose:

- Make critique constructive and precise
- Encourage iteration
- Normalize unfinished work

### Invisible Labor Moment

Short reflection on hidden infrastructures behind AI systems:

- Data labeling
- Content moderation
- Hardware and energy use
- Extraction and resource politics
- Maintenance and updates

Purpose:

- Expand awareness beyond interface-level interaction
- Connect technical practice to ethical and social implications

## Participation Philosophy

Participation in this course is not limited to speaking.
It includes:

- Sharing observations
- Contributing to discussions
- Presenting references
- Giving structured feedback
- Actively experimenting during live sessions

The studio operates as a shared learning environment rather than a broadcast lecture.

Flexibility is preserved across blocks while maintaining a consistent rhythm of engagement.
